a todo list project for the final project for CS 151


Project: To-Do List Application with GUI

Project Description:
  The goal of this project is to develop a Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that enables users to efficiently create, manage, and organize their to-do lists. The application will provide functionalities for adding, editing, and marking tasks as complete.

Note to Student:
  This project is designed for students with a basic understanding of Python programming. Familiarity with GUI development will be beneficial. The professor will be available for guidance and discussions, but self-driven learning and problem-solving skills are essential.

Project Goals:
  Create an intuitive GUI for the To-Do List Application.
  Implement functionality to add, edit, and mark tasks as complete.
  Enable users to organize tasks by priority or due date.

Success Metrics:
  Accurate management of to-do lists with proper addition, editing, and completion functionalities.
  User-friendly interface with intuitive navigation.
  Effective organization of tasks based on priority or due date.


Grading:
  Grading will be conducted weekly based on the submission and timeliness of the deliverables. The overall performance over the six weeks will determine the final grade.

Budget:
  No budget allocation is provided for this project. Students are encouraged to utilize open-source libraries and resources available online.

Project Communication Plan:
Weekly progress meetings will be held during office hours or at a time agreed upon by the group and instructor.


Communication with the professor will primarily occur through email for updates and issue tracking.


Communication with group members will occur as the members see fit.


Adherence to netiquette in all forms of communication is expected.


All the best on your project!
